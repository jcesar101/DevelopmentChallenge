    "summary": "Introduction Development Challenge: Pig Dice Game Overview This repository contains a robust, extensible implementation of the classic \"Pig\" dice game and its popular variations. The project was developed as part of a technical assessment, prioritizing clean code, domain-driven design (DDD), and architectural flexibility. Core Architectural Decisions 1. Strategy Pattern for Game Variations To accommodate four distinct rule sets (Standard 1-Dice, Standard 2-Dice, Big Pig, and Hog) without creating a \"God Object,\" I implemented the Strategy Pattern. IPigVariation Interface: Defines the contract for turn logic and scoring. Rule Agnosticism: The core game engine doesn't know which version it is playing; it simply processes the RollResult provided by the strategy. 2. Functional State Management I utilized C# Records for PlayerState and GameState. This ensures: Immutability: State cannot be modified unexpectedly; instead, a new state is returned via a \"transformer\" logic. Value-Based Equality: Simplifies testing and debugging by comparing data rather than object references. 3. Separation of Concerns The solution is divided into four distinct layers: Pig.Core: The \"Brain.\" Contains domain records and the state transition logic. Pig.Variations: The \"Rules.\" Encapsulates specific game mechanics. Pig.Console: The \"Skin.\" Handles I/O, user interaction, and the game loop. Pig.Tests: The \"Safety Net.\" xUnit tests covering all edge cases. 4. Deterministic Testing Rather than relying on System.Random in unit tests—which leads to flaky results—the test suite uses Deterministic Unit Testing. I inject specific dice arrays into the state transformer to verify that the game reacts correctly to specific outcomes (e.g., rolling double 1s in Big Pig). Tech Stack Language: C# 14 Runtime: .NET 10 (Current preview/latest support) Test Framework: xUnit"

Key Architectural Highlights Strategy Pattern: Employs an IPigVariation interface to handle diverse rulesets (Standard, Big Pig, Hog) without modifying core engine logic. Functional State Management: Uses C# Records for GameState and PlayerState to ensure immutability and value-based equality.
